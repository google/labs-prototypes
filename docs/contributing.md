## Contribution process

Since this is a repository for rapid prototyping and lightweight experiments, there are high chances for any of us to find issues on the code, test case failures etc at any time. In order to maintain the pace of the contribution rate we are employing two different strategies to tackle these problems.

-	### Fix-Forward stance
-	### Rollback stance

### Fix-Forward stance

We will follow Fix-Forward stance  when we find issues on the committed code which doesn't block the development of the team in our codebase we will keep moving forward with our current development and we will fix that issues on the upcoming commits.
In some cases when there is a major breaking change introduced to the code which blocks the team's progress, we will share the responsibility (we can also split the work among other team members if needed) and fix the issue together as a team.

### Rollback stance

We will follow Rollback stance when we start to work on the core functionalities. Whenever there is some issue on the code, we will reject the commit from the branch and the person who worked on the commit will fix the problem. 

## Code Reviews

Here code reviews are optional* with some exceptions i.e once you complete your work and if you are confident enough that your commit will not cause any problems, you can merge the pull request to the main . Otherwise All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) for this purpose.
