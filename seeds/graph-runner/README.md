# Graph Runner

The WIP bit of code that traverses the graph and invokes various node handlers.

This are the nascent docs and specs on the design of the graph and their traversal machinery.

To actually play with various graphs, see the [README.md](https://github.com/google/labs-prototypes/tree/main/seeds/graph-playground) in the `graph-playground` package of the `labs-prototypes` repo.

More to come soon.
