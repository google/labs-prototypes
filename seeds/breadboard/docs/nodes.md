# Breadboard's built-in nodes

To make boards run, we'll need to place nodes on them and then wire them together.

We can load various kits (like the [LLM Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/labs-prototypes/tree/main/seeds/llm-starter)) to get interesting node types. However, some node types are available without loading any kits.

These nodes make boards usable and easy to work with.

## The `input` node

Use this node to ask for input. The program that asked to run the board needs to supply it.

The node takes a property bag as its input and passes it along to the next node, unmodified.

### Example:

```js
board.input().wire("say->", board.output());

const result = await board.runOnce({
  say: "Hello, world!",
});

console.log("result", result);
```

Will produce this output:

```sh
result { say: 'Hello, world!' }
```

### Inputs:

- none

### Outputs:

- properties that are supplied by the program that runs the board.

## The `output` node

Use this node to get data out of the board. takes a property bag and sends it back to the applciation that ran the board, unmodified.

### Example:

```js
board.input().wire("say->", board.output());

board.runOnce({
  say: "Hello, world!",
});

console.log("result", result);
```

Will produce this output:

```sh
result { say: 'Hello, world!' }
```

### Inputs:

- any properties that the board wants to present to the program that runs the board.

### Outputs:

- none.

## The `passthrough` node

This is a no-op node. It takes the input property bag and passes it along as output, unmodified. This node can be useful when the board needs an entry point, but the rest of the board forms a cycle.

### Example:

```js
board.input().wire("say->", board.passthrough().wire("say->", board.output()));

board.runOnce({
  say: "Hello, world!",
});

console.log("result", result);
```

Will produce this output:

```sh
result { say: 'Hello, world!' }
```

See [Chapter 9: Let's build a chatbot](https://github.com/google/labs-prototypes/tree/main/seeds/breadboard/docs/tutorial#chapter-9-lets-build-a-chat-bot) of Breadboard tutorial to see another example of usage.

### Inputs

- any properties

### Outputs

- the properties that were passed as inputs

## The `include` node

Use this node to include other board into the current board. It recognizes `path` or `$ref` properties that specify, respectively, file path or URL to the serialized-as-JSON board to be included. It also accepts the `slotted` property that must contain the serialized-as-JSON boards that will be slotted into the included board.

The rest of the inputs in the property bag are passed along to the included board as its inputs. The outputs of the included board will be passed along as outputs of the `include` node.

This enables treating the included board as a kind of a node: it takes inputs and provides outputs.

### Example

For an example of how to use the `include` property, see [Chapter 5: Including other boards](https://github.com/google/labs-prototypes/tree/main/seeds/breadboard/docs/tutorial#chapter-5-including-other-boards) of Breadboard tutorial.

### Inputs

- `path`, which specifes the file path to the serialized board to be included. Either this or `$ref` property is required.
- `$ref`, which specifes the URL of the serialized board to be included. Ether this or `path` property is required.
- `slotted`, which specifies slotted boards that will be used to populate `slot` nodes in the included board. This property is optional.
- any other properties are passed as inputs for the included board.

### Outputs

- the outputs of the included board

## The `slot` node

Use this node to make a slot in a board. Adding a `slot` node turns a board into a sort of a template: each slot represents a placeholder that must be filled in when the node is included into another board.

The node takes a `slot` property, which specifies the name of the slot, and passes the rest of arguments to the slotted board. The value of the `slot` property is used to match the slot with one of the slotted board that is passed to the `include` node.

### Example

For an example of how to use the `slot` node, see [Chapter 6: Boards with slots](https://github.com/google/labs-prototypes/tree/main/seeds/breadboard/docs/tutorial#chapter-6-boards-with-slots) of Breadboard tutorial.

### Inputs

- `slot` - the name of the slot
- any other properties are passed as inputs for the slotted board

### Outputs

- the outputs of the included board

## The `reflect` node

This node is used to reflect the board itself. It has no required inputs and provides a JSON representation of the board as a `graph` output property. This node can be used for getting information that might be stored in the structure of the board.

### Example

```js
import { Board } from "@google-labs/breadboard";

const board = new Board();

board.input().wire("", board.reflect().wire("graph->", board.output()));

const result = await board.runOnce({});
console.log("result", result);
```

will print:

```sh
result {
  graph: {
    edges: [ [Object], [Object] ],
    nodes: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ],
    kits: []
  }
}
```

### Inputs

- ignored

### Outputs

- `graph` -- JSON representation of the board
